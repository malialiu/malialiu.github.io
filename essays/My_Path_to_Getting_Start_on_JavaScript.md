## What I Noticed at the beginning of learning JavaScript
Javascript is a computer language that applies to web browsers. Compare to other computer languages like Java and C, the function written in Javascript doesn't require people to write out a specific return type of a function. People require to write the specific return type for every function that is written in Java and C. Function that written in Javascript doesn't require to do what Java and C need to do, it can return an integer, string, float, etc, and even the function can be return by a function. Unlike C, Javascript cannot directly allocate memory, and it is less secure because it runs through the browser. 
### Advantages of JavaScipt Compare to Java and C
Javascript is similar to Java and C when writing them, there is a difference between them which is the way they declare a variable is different. They use keywords var, let, and const to declare a variable. Java and C declare a variable with keyword int, float, char, and etc. That's why sometimes the lines written in Javascript will be less than Java and C when solving small problems. Javascript is a good language in general because it is an efficient and fast language for web development. 
#### The Way I Practicing JavaScript
Doing more practice for learning a new computer language is helpful. A pedagogy called athletic software engineering is useful to do more practice in computer language, it let student complete tasks in limited time. It is stressful, but it also makes efficient coding speed and problem-solving for the future.
