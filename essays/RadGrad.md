It offers much information that is useful to build on a student's academic path or career paths includes interests, courses, and extracurricular activities. After finding out the interests corresponding to the courses and extracurricular, students will know better about their career paths. There is much information about extracurricular activities includes programs and projects.

Once student login to RadGrad, there are three tags in the home page that says high priority, medium priority, and completed. In the high priority, it will ask students to select their interests, courses, and extracurricular activities. In the beginning, I just try to fill out those high-priority tasks. After I added my interests to my profile, I noticed those interests will be lightened in the related courses and extracurricular. So it tells you what classes or extracurricular activities you might want to participate in based on your interests. It is really helpful, especially for those people who do not have a clear career goal. I have not known many careers in the computer field, the only two jobs I know when I was a freshman in college is software engineer, programmer, and web developer. In RadGrad, I know a new job named ux designer, which is design web application based on users' needs. I also find out the courses and extracurricular activities that related to this career. <br/>

After I added all interests, courses, and extracurricular activities that I might interest in. I started to plan my schedule for the future. In the planner, I do not feel I will be able to put all the courses and extracurricular activities that I interest in into the planner. So I remove some of them and add some of them to balance the activities in the planner. After I finished all the tasks in high priority, I did find out some possible career paths that I can go for based on my interest. It is helpful for me to clear my career path. I think it will be helpful for people to learn more information includes contact information about the extracurricular, and courses that build on your ability to achieve your future goal.
