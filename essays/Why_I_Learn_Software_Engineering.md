## What I Know Before Learning Software Engineering
There are many definitions of software engineering online. But in general, the main goal of software engineering is to design, develop, and maintenance software applications to solve real-life problems.
I didn't know what is software engineering when I was a kid. As time passed, people using more and more software applications in daily life, the software engineering becomes important and popular. 


## What I Know at the Beginning About Software Engineering

Software engineering includes many aspects like hardware/software selection, database management, human-computer interaction, and a lot of technical aspects. As I going through many technical aspects that software engineering covers, I'm interested in database management, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. Database management is to organize data, especially large amounts of data since more and more people are using a computer to save their works. Human-computer interaction studies the relationship between user and computer system. The computer system can be various machines. Computer vision is using a machine instead of human eyes to detect things. The reason why I interested in those aspects is because I want to develop a game like what is in a anime named "Sword Art Online". Even it is really hard to make a game like that, but I'm still interest in any informations about these. At least learning new things is not a bad idea.

Since I haven't learned many things in computer science, I would take classes that cover the information about those three aspects in the future. Also export my career path in the future, practicing more in my programming skills, and improve my ability to problem-solve with a computer.
