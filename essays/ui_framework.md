By getting start on UI frameworks, I was using the Semantic UI to help building the website page. I find out that Semantic UI is really helpful, espacially the icons provided by the Semantic UI can save a lot of time from looking for a image as a icon, or making a icon. Once people getting use of the Semantic UI, the contents it provides can help people to build the user interface easier and nicer. For example, the icons, it provides lots of icons as the following picture shows, once we want to use the icons, we can write ```<i class="ui (any name of the icons) icon"></i>``` in HTML file to include this icon in out page. 

If we use the raw HTML and CSS, it means that we have to build everything by ourself includes icons, layout, menu, button, and etc. The most benefit of the UI frameworks is that people are getting a organized website which will be helpful for users to understand how to use the website.
