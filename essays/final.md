I haven't got many ideas about software engineering before I take the course about software engineering. After this course I learned about the basics for build a website and team work in programming project. Because most of the classes I took before this software engineering class doesn't have much opportunities for the team work. So it gained more experience about how software engineers might work in real life. There are many tools/things that are helpful to build a website by myself or work as team, which includes github, robo3T, intelliJ, testcafe, meteor, react, and etc.

The first thing we might want to learn to build a website will be html, css, and JavaScript. Html and css are using for building the user interface, and JavaScript will be using for functionality. And there is a library that are helpful for JavaScript which is underscore.js. People can use it by add the url provided from the website [http://underscorejs.org/#](http://underscorejs.org/#) to fill in the src ```<script src="..."></script>``` in html file. Then we can using _.each instead of writing a whole for loop or while loop.

Then we learn about the react and meteor, react are the front-end rendering library and meteor provides core packages publications and methods. There are many stuffs in react that are helpful to make a nice user interface. [https://react.semantic-ui.com/](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) which we can also use it by putting the url in the src ```<script src="..."></script>``` in html file. Create a directory for a project and put ```npx create-react-app my-app``` in terminal, then put ```cd app``` and npm run will run your app. For meteor, it contains a lot of method we can use, the hardest part I had found is to manage the accounts in meteor. For more detail, please check on the code in [https://github.com/the-club-for-you/the-club-for-you/tree/issue-26](https://github.com/the-club-for-you/the-club-for-you/tree/issue-26). After building a website there are some useful tool to check everything works or not, robo3T help us to check on the database for the website and we can add whatever things we want to check in testcafe to check everything works ok or not by running a command in terminal app directory run ```meteor npm run start```, then run ```meteor npm run testcafe-development``` in another terminal. We can also updated the testcafe to github and everytime when we updated our code we can see the code are passing the test or not, which make it easier to identify the problems.

That's most of the stuffs for building an website. The most things I enjoy are building a website in a team, there are many things on github millstone and issue assign are useful when we work as team, these help us to build our website[https://uhmtheclubforyou.xyz/#/](https://uhmtheclubforyou.xyz/#/) I think I'm really enjoy working in team and gain a lot experience for working on the project and identify bugs and solve them.
