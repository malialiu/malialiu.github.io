# Daily Planner
## Overview:
### Problem: 
Some students are having hard time on manage their time with all the deadline of assignments, labs, projects, etc, because they need to check on the deadline frequently for different classes to make sure they didn't forget it. 
### Solution: 
Create an app for students can able to check on the deadline on each day (like calendar), and reminds them one day before the deadline. (similiar to laulima but just the calendar that generate all the courses that student taking on one calendar.)
## Mockup Page Ideas:
### Visitor:
  - Main page 
  - Sign in/out page 
  - Calendar page 
  - Setting personal event page
  - Reminder setting page 
  
### Admin:
  - Main page
  - Sign/out page
  - Calendar page (for specific course)
  - Setting deadline page
    
## Use Case Ideas:
  - Students will need to login to look at their calendar and add new event on the calendar.
  - Admin will need to login to view all the course they have and setting the deadline.
  
## Beyond The Basics
  - All the deadlines on Laulima can shows on calendar page once they login with @hawaii.edu
  - Avoid procrastination mode: pushing all the deadline on calendar page one day before.
